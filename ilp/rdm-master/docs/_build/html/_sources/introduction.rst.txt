Introduction
============

This is the documentation for the Python-RDM package for relational data mining.
The aim of this tool is to make relational learning and inductive logic programming approaches publicly accessible.
The tool offers a common and easy-to-use interface to several relational learning algorithms and provides data
access to several relational database management systems. To this end we have developed a stand-alone Python
library and a corresponding package for the open source ClowdFlows online data mining platform.
